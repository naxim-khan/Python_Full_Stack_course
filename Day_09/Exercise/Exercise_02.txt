 Nesting
it's simply means putting one item inside another item

E.g: dictionary= {key:Value} here is just simple dictionary with one key
dictionary={key: value,
            key2: value,} here we add another dictionary using ','
similarly we can also assign a value of list to a key in dictionary like below
and also assign another dictionary value to a key in other dictionary.

dictionary={key: [List],
            key2: {Dict},}
