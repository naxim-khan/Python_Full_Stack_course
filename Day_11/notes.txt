Day 11 Project BlackJack Capstone Project
Requirement's:
A game that's Played using cards , And the goal of the game
is to add up your card to the largest number
without going over 21 if the cards in your hand add up to more than 21
then it's called a Bust and it's mean's that you lose immediately. and the cards from 2- 10 as count as their face value same like 6+9+10
but the jack (j) and king (k) and (q) queen count as 10. and the other special card is the Ace (A) now the A card is count as either is 1 towards your total . or it can count as an 11. and it's depending on whether if you gone over 21 or whether you under 21 You can decide which value of A you want to count

Lets say:
the Dealer = got 10 to begin with
and You = got a Q to begin (Q=10)
in the 2nd round you don't know the dealer card that what's his card 
value to count 
and the with you is 3 which Q+3 is 13
at this point you may ask the dealer for another card so now you have 3 cards 
and it's adds upto 20 the third card you have is 7 but there is also a possibilty that you might have another card of 10 that you cross the 21 in third round and you may lose 

if the dealer reveal his 2nd round and they have 20 and you have also 20 then it's consider a draw.
if the dealer have the card of A and your total is 10 in this the dealer is win because you can count the A card value is 11.
which increase the dealer score upto 21
If the dealer score is less than you'rs then they must take another card
