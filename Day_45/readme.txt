Scraping The web with BeautifulSoup

We've been working for API's for quite a while now and we know
that we can use a website API to access their data or to interact
with the website using code
But some websites don't have an API or their API doesn't let us 
to use some things that we want to access.
So this where we started to think about Web Scraping.

were we look to the underlying html code of a website to get hold
of the information that we want.

so the Aim ot today is to learn how to make soup.

What is BeautifulSoup?
A Module that's helps developer. to make sense of websites 
we can think of a lot of websites a bit of a spagatty soups
even something seeminly as simple as the google front page.
if you click inspect and view the google source code 
then there will be a lot random things come which we can't understand
but there will be a parsor so that you can find and full out the 
html elements that you're intersted in.
from this soup of jumble html code.
For Example we can go to a website 
which shows 100 Greatest Movies of all the time.
and this python program will suggest us movies to watch from there.

is Webscraping legal.?
In some cases it's legall and some cases it's illegal.
The data which is publically available and not copyrighted in this webscraping to this data is llegal.
