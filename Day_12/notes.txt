Local vs. Global Scope

Scope: What's is scope ?
If you want to visualize this concept of scope . imagine You have
a house with a fence sarrounded and you plant an apple tree inside Your garden
think about who can access those apples the answer is simple just 
you and your family have access to the apples.
But what if instead if you have an apple tree  in your neighbour hood
well  this is kind of free for all. Any body can go and access those apples. 
this is the starting point for how to understand scope.

______________________________________
BLOCK SCOPE (Does python have Block Scope?)
There is no such thing like Block scope in python.
eg: 
game_leve=3
enemies=["SkeletonðŸ’€","Zombie ðŸ‘»","Aliens ðŸ‘½"]
if game_level<5:
    new_enemy=enemies[0]
print(new_enemy)
output : SkeletonðŸ’€
It's that you create a variable inside a block of if else or while loop or for loop than that's not counting as creating a local scope. it's should consider Global in python.
